## MemeMarketplace DApp

Meme marketplate DApp: made with Near-AS-SDK, IPFS and React

The app is hosted here: [https://aishat-akinyemi.github.io/near-meme-marketplace-dapp](https://aishat-akinyemi.github.io/near-meme-marketplace-dapp)

The marketplace metadata is stored on IPFS, and price, owner and sales data stored on the NEAR blockchain.


This MemeMarketplace dapp was created as my submission to NEAR 101 Challenge on Dacade. [Join dacade](https://dacade.org/signup?invite=aishatakinyemi) to not just learn how to build blockchain solutions, but earn while you do so.
